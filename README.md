# Boids-algorithm

In 1986 Craig Reynolds published the paper "Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model", in which he explored how simple rules applied to individuals could lead to the
emergence of collective motion at large scale.

The study of the boids (shortened version of "bird-oid") model has a multitude of applications ranging from the study of prey-predator relationships in ecosystems, simulations
of a crowd of people at a stampede in case of a terrorist attack, programming drone swarms,
animation for the movement of flocks and herds in movies and video games...

The aim of this project is to build a boids simulation from scratch in python. The simulation is used to investigate the emergence of collective behavior and patterns, exploring
how different parameters affect the dynamics of the system.
